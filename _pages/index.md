I work at the interface between experimental and computational biology, combining imaging and data analysis to investigate weird stuff that bacteria do.  Currently I am a PhD candidate in the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego, where I study how biological life revives from total dormancy.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, Dr. Hiroaki Kitano at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm), and  [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at International Christian University.

In my free time I like to cook, read, carve, or wheelthrow.
