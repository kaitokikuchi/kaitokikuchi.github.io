I'm a computational biologist/data scientist currently at [ThinkCyte](https://thinkcyte.com/). I'm generally interested in applying machine learning to biological problems, and also enjoy thinking about better workflows to analyze biological data.

I earned my PhD from the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego, researching electric decision making in dormant microbes. Additionally, I've worked with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, Dr. Hiroaki Kitano at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm), and  [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at the International Christian University.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about cooking, reading, spoon carving, and pottery. I'm currently based in San Diego, CA.
