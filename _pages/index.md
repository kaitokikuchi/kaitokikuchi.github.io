I work at the interface between experimental and computational biology, combining imaging and data analysis to investigate funny and unintuitive biological phenomena.  I recently defended my PhD from the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego, where I studied how biological life revives from total dormancy using electrochemical dynamics.

Previously, I worked with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, Dr. Hiroaki Kitano at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm), and  [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at the International Christian University.

In my free time I like to cook, read, carve, and wheelthrow.
