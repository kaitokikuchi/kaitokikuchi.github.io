I am a quantitative biologist/data scientist interested in using image data to quantify biology. I currently work at [Reveal Biosciences](https://www.revealbio.com/) as an Image Analysis Scientist, where I develop machine-learning based pipelines to automate digital pathology.

I got my PhD from the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego, where I studied how biological life revives from total dormancy using electrochemical dynamics. I also worked with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, Dr. Hiroaki Kitano at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm), and  [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at the International Christian University.

In my free time I like to cook, read, carve, and wheelthrow.
