I'm a quantitative biologist/data scientist currently advancing machine-learning pipelines for digital pathology automation at [Reveal Biosciences](https://www.revealbio.com/). I'm generally interested in applying machine learning to biological problems, and I'm particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and microscopy. I'm also interested in the intersection of machine learning and pottery, but that's a different story.

I earned my PhD from the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/) at UC San Diego, researching electric decision making in dormant microbes. Additionally, I've worked with [Dr. Yuichi Wakamoto](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo, Dr. Hiroaki Kitano at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm), and  [Dr. Tatsuo Nunoshiba](https://researchers.icu.ac.jp/icuhp/KgApp?kyoinId=ymkmgiyeggy&Language=2) at the International Christian University.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about cooking, reading, spoon carving, and pottery. I'm currently based in San Diego, CA.
