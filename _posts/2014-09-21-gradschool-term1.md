## Long Overdue Update
Hi there! Long time no see huh? Like.... just 5 months! what....

## My first term at Todai
You know, its quite tedious to do something (or more usually, somethings) while thinking about another deadline coming up ahead. And turns out that attending Gradschool is to juggle multiple deadlines, do research, and try to live your life all at the same time. \\
\\
In short, I'm immensely relaxed right now because I have gone through all the deadlines I had (at least, all that I could remember). I've taken 22 units of coursework in my first term (April 2014 ~ August 2014), which is quite a lot considering that the total requirement for the 2-year Master's course is 30 units. And adapting to a new school and starting a research project is no child's play either.\\
\\
I'm happy to say that the transition had gone smoothly. My new supervisor Yuichi Wakamoto is an absolute gentleman and unfathomably sharp. I got to make a lot of brilliant friends, mostly through [a graduate program](http://ihs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) that I got into besides my department major. I found a [great coffee roaster/cafe](http://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1318/A131810/13162503/) just behind the campus. And after all, starting research is a very exciting process in itself.

## Right now
As I'm mostly freed from coursework, and classes start only from the second week of October, right now I'm tinkering away with a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) that I got from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1914). I've never done any serious electronics work before, but the RasPi strikes just the right balance between being too intimidating and downright boring. I'm aiming to host my Gollum-powered lab notebook wiki on the RasPi to enable external access to the wiki 7/24. So far, so good.
