## Long Overdue Update
Hi there! Long time no see huh? Like.... just 5 months! Pshaw, nothing to fuss about.

## Back to the `__Future__`
In the meantime, I had been admitted into a [wierd extracurricular program inside the U of Tokyo](http://ihs.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) that trains students to easen up the brittle walls between grad school disciplines, which is a problem that usually stems from Profs not students, but nontheless the program itself is quite cool. We even get to have a modest stipend, which of course is a carrot-stick to all graduate students.\\
\\
The program ("IHS") has a lot of interesting but demanding classes that students need to enrol and complete on top of their usual course work, but the good thing is there are a ton of fun projects that one usually never gets to see in a Japanese grad school. I myself was selected to join a  weeklong trip at Kyoto to explore how Fengshui and other traditional philosophies shaped the ancient city.
