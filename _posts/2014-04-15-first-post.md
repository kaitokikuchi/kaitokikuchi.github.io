## Well Hello!
I have longed for a personal homepage/blog for a quite a chunk of my lengthy 22 year life. After reading that GitHub allows free hosting with custom domains, acquiring the domain `kaito.co` and setting up this page with a bit of Jekyll blackmagic by the [Minimal Mistakes theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) was a pretty straightforward process.

## What I Will Do
I plan to make this a place to point people who have kindly become interested enough in me for further information, be it academical ([see my CV!](http://www.kaito.co/about/)) or more hobby-related (I plan to upload lots of photos taken with my NIKON D7000). I will also try to update the blog section so as to de-rust my English.

## And You
Please feel free to comment, discuss, or chat with me in the below Disqus Comments. No SPAM will be tolerated, but I'm sure the world needs your thoughts. In other words, PLEASE WRITE!!
