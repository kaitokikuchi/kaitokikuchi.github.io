This book is about two time-traveling superagents that initially try to kill each other but fall in love and rail against the system (?). The question mark is because the book mostly consists of poetic love letters that positively *ooze* with such angsty-edgy-teenager energy that the actual plot never really sat with me long enough to grasp. The two superagents are female, so I appreciate this gay scifi aspect. However, that does not absolve the authors' continuous barrage of "romance" that ranged from very basic to absurdly childish, while simultaneously having zero emotional resonance. Not a mean feat, this.   

I guess it was also wrong of me to expect this book to finally deliver a believable time travel story, a genre that I consider to be the literary equivalent of communism: sounds very cool, but never executed without morphing into a dreadful monster. There were occasional hints of brilliance, like the idea of future civilizations weaving together past timelines to lead to their own, or the idea that said future civilizations are either hyper-AI or mega-bioorganism, but these were never explored beyond surface level and just got buried by meters of inane posturing.

The fact that this book has two authors also felt more like a gimmick than a feature. El-Mohtar and Gladstone's writing styles were not distinct enough to bring intrigue to the two corresponding characters, but also not seamless enough to avoid a sense of incongruity. Again, cool idea, poorly executed.
