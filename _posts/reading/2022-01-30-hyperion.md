Wikipedia tells me that this is a cult classic, although I must confess that I didn't know about it until late last year. Interesting structure with each chapter is told through a different character, much in the tradition of *The Canterbury Tales* or *The Decameron*, gradually filling out the world setting and each other's backstories. Also kinda like some JRPGs. This also enabled the author to mix in a variety of different story styles, which enriched the world building and fleshed out each character's personality. I found it quite depressing in the end, and didn't make me want to continue the series, but *Hyperion*'s strongly visual storytelling throughout would undoubtedly lend for screen adaptation (which seems to be happening sometime??).
