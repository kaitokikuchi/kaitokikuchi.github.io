Wikipedia tells me that this is a cult classic, although I must confess that I didn't know about it until late last year. It has an interesting structure with each chapter told through a different character, much in the tradition of *The Canterbury Tales* or *The Decameron*, gradually filling out the world setting and character backstories. Also kinda like some JRPGs. This also enabled the author to mix in a variety of different story styles, which enriched the world building and character personalities.  

I found the ending quite depressing, and didn't make me want to continue the series, but *Hyperion*'s strongly visual storytelling is undoubtedly ripe for screen adaptation (which seems to be happening sometime??).
