I got this book after seeing it recommended on Twitter, and it's a great coffee table book for anyone interested in electronics. The book is a collection of more than 130 electrical components, ranging from simple carbon film resistors to a smartphone camera. Each component is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the design, and the book is beautifully illustrated with cross-section photographs of the circuits.

While marveling at the ingenuity and function that goes into each tiny device, I realized how strikingly similar it is to how I feel learning about biology — except that every iteration is documented and the human intent that went into the design is explainable! I especially enjoyed the chapter on electromechanics, where the cross-section photographs really brought the form-to-function relationship to life. I never imagined that a toggle switch contained a metal see-saw, but now it seems so obvious!
