I read this book after [Loonshots](https://www.kaito.co/reading/loonshots/), and while they both talk about similar themes (how to make better organizations), and even use the same case studies (Bell Labs, DARPA red balloon challenge, etc), I found myself liking TCC better. Anecdotal stories are told more organically, and the take-home morals are dispensed with more clarity. I'm excited to become a better listener and facilitator using what I've learned.
