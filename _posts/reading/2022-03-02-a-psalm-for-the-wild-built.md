I picked up this book somewhat randomly, encouraged by its pretty cover and backcover reviews that mentioned words like "optimistic", "kind", and "felt like a warm cup of tea". I can confirm that all of the above were all very much true and reading *Psalm* was one of the most therapeutic things I've done in a long time.
