I picked up this book somewhat randomly, encouraged by its pretty cover and backcover reviews that mentioned words like "optimistic", "kind", and "felt like a warm cup of tea". I can confirm that all of the above were all very much true and reading *Psalm* was one of the most therapeutic things I've done in a long time.  

I'm sure everyone had a touch of burnout and soul-searching during the past two years of global pandemic. I sure have, and I immediately identified with the serious but whimsical protagonist Dex and their quest to find "purpose" in life. Oh by the way, *Psalm* was the first book that I read with a gender nonbinary character as the protagonist and I enjoyed how much it was a nonissue in the storytelling. One of the many ways the world is "an optimistic vision" as Martha Wells writes in the cover. But back to my point, this book felt particularly poignant as I prepare to defend my PhD and move beyond the academic path that I was so sure of treading on. This book reminded me that we don't need our work to be *enough*, it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. That we are allowed to just *live*.

Becky Chambers has a special gift in writing sentences that make you smile, giggle softly, and feel warm all over. And making us realize that all we need is a happy robot friend.
