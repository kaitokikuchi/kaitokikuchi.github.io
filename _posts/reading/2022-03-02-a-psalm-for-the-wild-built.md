I picked up this book somewhat randomly, encouraged by its pretty cover and backcover reviews that mentioned words like "optimistic", "kind", and "felt like a warm cup of tea". I can confirm that all of the above were very much true and reading *Psalm* was one of the most therapeutic things I've done in a long time.  

Like many others, I had my own share of burnout and soul-searching during the past two pandemic years, and the protagonist Dex's quest to find "purpose" in life resonated deeply with me. Oh by the way, *Psalm* was the first book that I read with a gender nonbinary protagonist and I enjoyed how much it was a nonissue in the storytelling (one of the many ways the world is "an optimistic vision"). But back to my point, this book felt particularly poignant as I prepare to defend my PhD and move beyond. This book reminded me that we don't need our work to be *enough*, it is enough to exist in the world and marvel at it. That we are allowed to just *live*.
