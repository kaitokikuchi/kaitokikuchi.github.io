I am a Master's student studying cellular heterogeneity in the [Yuichi Wakamoto lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo. I am looking into the physical properties of E. coli cytoplasm, and also attempting to establish a single-cell optogenetics platform. \\

I am also affiliated with the Systems Biology Institute as a Student Research Assistant, where I work on a network biology project. \\
\\
In my free time I love to bike, travel, drink coffee, and enjoy Japanese Sake (Kazenomori 風の森 is my current favorite). I am also wandering into photography with my trustworthy NIKON D7000.
