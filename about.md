I am a Masters student at the University of Tokyo, studying cellular heterogeneity at [Prof. Yuichi Wakamoto's lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html). I am interested in how cells in a clonal population behave different (cell-to-cell individuality), and also in how heterogeneous systems behave in response to stress. 


I love to bike, travel, drink coffee, and Japanese Sake (Jikon 而今 is my current favorite).
