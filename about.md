I am a Masters student at the University of Tokyo, studying cellular heterogeneity under Prof. Yuichi Wakamoto. 

Current interests include:

- phenotypic variation
- gene expression fluctuation
- single-cell analysis
- antibiotic persistence


I love to bike, travel, drink coffee, and Japanese Sake (Jikon 而今 is my current favorite).
