I am a Ph.D student at the [SÃ¼el Lab](http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/suel/), UC San Diego. I am interested in quantitative analyses of microbial community dynamics, and am affiliated with the [qBio Specialization](http://qbio.ucsd.edu/). \\
\\
I did my Masters at the [University of Tokyo](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) doing *E. coli* single cell observations, and was a Research Assistant at the [Systems Biology Institute](http://sbi.jp/aboutSBI.htm) mining PPi Networks. \\
\\
In my free time I love to cook/bake, (body)surf, bike, travel, and drink coffee/beer.
