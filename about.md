I am a Master's student studying cellular heterogeneity at the [Yuichi Wakamoto lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html), the University of Tokyo. Research projects involve measuring E. coli cytoplasm fluidity and developing an optogenetic system, both at the single-cell level. \\
\\
I am also affiliated with the Systems Biology Institute as a Student Research Assistant, where I work on a Protein-Protein Interaction Network analysis project. \\
\\
In my free time I love to bike, travel, drink coffee, and enjoy Japanese Sake (Kazenomori 風の森 is my current favorite). I take photos with my NIKON D7000 and send them over to my iPhone for editing (WiFi-enabled SD cards are the BEST).
