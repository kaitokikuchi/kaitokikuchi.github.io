I am a Master's student studying cellular heterogeneity in the [Yuichi Wakamoto lab](http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/wakamoto-lab/index_e.html) at the University of Tokyo. Current research projects include measuring bacterial cytoplasm fluidity and investigating its relationship with cell state, and also trying to establish an optogenetics platform at the single-cell level. I am also affiliated with the Systems Biology Institute as a Student Research Assistant, where I work on a network biology project. \\

I love to bike, travel, drink coffee, and Japanese Sake (Kazenomori 風の森 is my current favorite).
